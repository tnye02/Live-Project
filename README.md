# Live-Project
For the live project, I chose to make a basic database site to keep track of items from the video game Valheim. A number of these sites do exist, 
The Valehim Wiki of course, found here: https://valheim.fandom.com/wiki/Valheim_Wiki. My overall goal, time permitting, was to have a site that would allow the user to 
choose an enemy and show which weapons were most effective against that enemy as well as what types of damage each weapon would do, and how much damage of each type.

Here are some samples of my work from the Live Project

## This the function that allows the user to add an item to the database:

## This is the function that allows the user to edit a database object:
 ![Edit_Item](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/317563/138614531-b795afb9-125e-40a5-9fdf-abb8aa563596.jpg)


## These are the two functions dedicated to deleting a database item:
